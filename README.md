###Started from
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/15283/i-am-trying-to-create-a-simple-frontend-form-for-posting

###Todos..

1. Better way for AJAX loading gif.
2. Server side validation needs to be fixed.
3. Inline images uploaded by `Add Media` button need to update `post_parent` to the newly created post's ID. Currently set to `0` on v 1.3

###Plans
*I'm thinking about making this to a single page application(kind of) using AJAX technology. You only have to add one shortcode into your page/post and on that page, you can write, read, edit and delete all of your content.*
Yes, I definitely need your help to make this plug in better. Sounds interesting to you? Please feel free to talke me at
